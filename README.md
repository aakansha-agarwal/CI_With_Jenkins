**Continuous Integration with Jenkins**

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) in software development. 
It automates building, testing, and deploying applications, allowing teams to deliver software faster and more reliably.

**Key Features:**

**Pipeline as Code:** Define CI processes using a domain-specific language for easy version control.

**Extensibility:** Integrate with numerous tools through a wide range of plugins.

**Distributed Builds:** Execute builds across multiple machines to reduce build times.

**Monitoring and Reporting:** Provides real-time insights into build and test statuses.

**Using Jenkins in CI:**

**Set Up Jenkins:** Install and connect it to your version control system.

**Create a Job:** Define the steps for building, testing, and deploying your application.

**Trigger Builds:** Automatically start builds based on events like code commits.

**Run Tests:** Integrate automated testing to catch issues early.

**Deployment:** Automate the deployment of applications to different environments.

By using Jenkins for CI, teams can enhance collaboration and improve software quality.
